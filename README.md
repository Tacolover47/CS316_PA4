# CS316_PA4
This project is a website that implements a login portal with the functionality to register new users, have current users sign-in, and allows users to change their account information. The front end uses Bootstrap for styling and Handlebars for HTML templating. The backend is primarily Javascript with Express to create and run the server and uses the conf library to implement a relational database. 

This repo is for a project I did in Spring 2020 for CS316 at UKY.
